## How I worked on this project
My goal was to  build a web app that requires state management

* I built this app using designs I created with Figma: (Link to the designs)[https://www.figma.com/file/799csrNpHmOP03B7hYGIrS/Iconium-Store?node-id=0%3A1]
* I built this app using NextJS and SASS
* I used Redux Toolkit to provide state management

## How to navigate this project
* `components` folder contains the code for each component.
* `pages` folder contains the code for each page.
* `public` folder contains the images I used for this project.
* `redux` folder contains the code for state management.
* `styles` folder contains the styling for each page and component.
* `tests` folder contains all the tests I wrote for this project.

## Why I built this project this way
* I used NextJS for this project because it renders React from the server side which makes it safer and faster for the end user.
* Using Redux Toolkit helps me manage complex state between components.
* Using CSS modules helps me avoid naming clashes between different CSS classes.
* I used a REST API for this project because I realized that working with REST APIs is an essential part of the job of a frontend developer.
* I also wrote tests for the essential components of this project.

## If I had more time I would change this
* I would add a database of real products using Firebase
* I would complete the payment integration features
